                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Howie Woiwod and I am a watchmaker. I studied this craft at the Ã‰cole nationale de
                    l'horlogerie in Trois Rivieres, Quebec and graduated as a certified Watchmaker December of 2016. Such a
                    great experience because I got some fantastic hands-on training at a world class facility.
                </p>
                <p> I got my real world experience working for Jason at Roldorf and Co. in Vancouver for 3 great years.
                    Having the opportunity to work for an independent was extremely valuable as I have seen and worked on
                    many types of watches, like Rolex and Omega and all the common household brands plus many more. I
                    enthusiastically faced plenty of challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also part of the design and manufacturing of the Halios Seaforth "Roldorf Edition" with Jason
                    Gallop of Roldorf and Co and Jason Lim of Halios watches. This was an incredible ride and a dream come
                    true. You can read about this experience and others on my blog page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to serve the watch community with a loving touch and an open heart. Watches serve so many
                    purposes in our lives and each one has a unique story. I'd like to bridge the gap that many watchmakers
                    have with clients by offering a customer based web experience using video to it's potential.
